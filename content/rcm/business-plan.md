# RCM — Living Business Plan (v0.1a)

> Promise: **Ship a small, fast thing that works; teach the team to run it; improve weekly.**
> Guardrails: no heavy custom apps, enterprise e-comm, or 24/7 support.

## Positioning
- **Category:** Creative studio (brand/content/lightweight web) with practical AI fluency.
- **ICP:** Founder-led companies, boutique firms, solo experts, niche media.
- **Why us:** Senior judgment, editorial taste, repeatable systems; ship-first bias.

## Offers (repeatable)
1. **Lightweight Site Sprint (1–2 wks)**
   Outcome: Home/About/Services/Journal, clean IA, fast pages, basic SEO/meta, analytics, lead capture.
   Stack: Ghost+Summit (or static), Notion, GA/Tag, Buttondown/Substack.
2. **Brand & Starter Content Kit (2–3 wks)**
   Name/tagline options, tone guide, color/type tokens, 5–7 page copy, 3 posts, 6 social posts, simple asset kit.
3. **Podcast/Video Starter (1–2 wks)**
   One publish-ready episode; script, Descript project, thumbnail template, upload flow, show notes.
4. **Cadence Retainer (monthly)**
   Weekly working session; 2–4 shipped items/month; dashboard.

> **Pricing guidance:** Site $3k–$8k · Brand Kit $5k–$12k · Pod/Video $2k–$6k · Retainer $1.5k–$4k/mo.

## Process (golden path)
1) Kickoff → goals, audience, constraints, **definition of done**.
2) **Vibe-coding** → copy-first prototype in code; ship smallest useful slice.
3) Ship → live pages/posts/assets.
4) Measure → speed, cadence, signups/leads.
5) Iterate weekly → tiny deltas, no scope creep.

**Service levels:** async ≤ 24–48h weekdays; 60–90m weekly session.

## Metrics we promise
- **Time-to-first-publish:** ≤ 7–10 days
- **Cadence:** 1–2 pieces/week after starter
- **Page speed:** Lighthouse "Good" on core pages
- **Lead capture live:** working CTA + list tracking

## GTM (concise)
- Channels: br.com essays; LinkedIn; warm network; small podcasts; targeted intros.
- Lead magnets: "Founder Site Sprint (1-pager)", "Vibe-coding Runbook (90-min)".

## 90-Day Plan
- **Month 1:** Ship RCM site slice + 4 posts; publish Site Sprint 1-pager; 3 intro calls.
- **Month 2:** 1 client sprint; +4 posts; 1 case note.
- **Month 3:** 1–2 clients; +4 posts; launch cadence retainer.

## Roles & Capacity
- **Barry:** strategy, positioning, editorial interviews, taste.
- **Griffin:** technical prototyping, AI tools, light integrations, vibe-coding coaching.
- **Specialists (as needed):** design polish/illustration.
- **Capacity:** now 1 client → next 60–90d: 2 parallel.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Scope creep → fixed scope + backlog review.
- Design lift → bring in specialist; keep system small.
- Client availability → calendar holds + async templates.
